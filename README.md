# Python Mad Libs

The **Mad Libs** are an introduction to the Python programming language. I learned about what backend development is and how Python differs from other programming languages. I used what I have learned so far to create a Mad Lib Console game. Enjoy!

## Concepts Learned From the Build:

 - Backend vs. Front-end development 
 - How to run a Python file 
 - Strings in Python
 - How to print a string to the console
 - String formatting
 - Using Python's input function
